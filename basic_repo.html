            <h1>Hello Git</h1>
            <p>I am a Software Engineering student at Coding Dojo. I am new to git and I am still learning! :) I am looking forward to gain more knowledge and hone my skills. It has been very hard for me these past two months but I am hanging in there! I know that all the hardships and sacrifices will all be worth it in the end! :)</p>
